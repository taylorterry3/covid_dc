Washington DC Public Schools Covid Case Data Tools
---

This repo contains some functions and a notebook for scraping DC Public Schools' school by school covid incident data. This data is unfortunately not posted in any organized dashboard, so it has to be extracted from the text of letters sent to parents and other stakeholders and posted on https://dcpsreopenstrong.com.

Currently I am just running the code in `notebooks/DC_schools_covid.ipynb` and pasting to a google sheet, which powers a dashboard at https://datastudio.google.com/s/reG0hZFCICM.

This data is not perfect, and I have made some judgement calls in how to handle malformed data. Any requests, comments, or issues can be raised as issues on this repo or sent to me directly at https://twitter.com/taylorterry.
