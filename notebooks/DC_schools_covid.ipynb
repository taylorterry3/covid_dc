The individual is no longer on campus and will not return until medically cleared. As determined by the DCPS Contact Tracing team, DC Health, and in accordance with the district’s COVID-19 health and safety guidance, unless you have received instructions directly, your student has not been identified as a close contact of the positive individual and does not need to be tested or self-quarantine. Persons for whom we know were in close contact with the positive individual were notified and provided guidance on next steps, including how any students impacted would receive instruction during quarantine. For your awareness, DC Health defines a close contact in a PK-12 setting as, “Someone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period, starting from two days before illness onset (or for asymptomatic infected people, two days prior to positive test collection) until the time the infected person is isolated.” Since DCPS has layered mitigation measures in place at our schools, students who were in a classroom and within 3 to 6 feet of another student who reported a positive test such that all were engaged in consistent and correct use of well-fitting face masks are not considered a close contact. This means that some classmates may not receive instructions to quarantine due to these measures. Additionally, upon notification of the positive case, and out of an abundance of caution, the building will be cleaned and disinfected, including classrooms, office areas, conference rooms, and other common areas. We all play a role in protecting ourselves, our family, and our school community from COVID-19. That is why we encourage you to take the Stronger & Safer Together Pledge that includes everyday steps to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep our community safe. • Regardless of your vaccination status, if you are waiting for a COVID-19 test result that was taken after symptoms, please stay at home until you receive a negative test result. • If you receive a positive test result OR are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath — please stay at home and isolate from others in your household, notify your school immediately, and contact your healthcare provider. • We highly encourage our students and families to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Visit vaccinate.dc.gov to get started and find a free school clinic near you. I know that this has been a trying time for our community. We will continue to keep you informed about our health and safety measures and work together to ensure we have a strong, robust, and safe school year.

Persons for whom we know were in close contact with the individual were immediately notified and provided guidance based on DC Health and CDC guidelines. Close contact is defined as: (1) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time (e.g., being in the same office or classroom as a positive and symptomatic individual), or (2) having direct contact with the infectious secretions from an individual with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on). Note: The definition of “close contact” does not include all other individuals on the same floor or in the same building as a positive individual, unless they also meet criteria (1) or (2). Per current DC Health guidance, you do not need to be tested or undergo voluntary quarantine based on this possible exposure. However, we strongly urge you to closely monitor yourself and your family for symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If you develop any of these symptoms at all, please stay home and contact your healthcare provider immediately for advice. You should also contact your school to let them know your student will be staying home. As a reminder, here are the steps that we can all take to keep ourselves, families, and others around us safe from COVID-19: • Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, after using the restroom, and upon returning home • Cover your cough and/or sneeze into a tissue then discard in the trash and immediately wash your hands for 20 secs or use hand sanitizer • Avoid touching your eyes, face, and mouth • Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces • Stay home if you are sick • Practice social distancing • Visit coronavirus.dc.gov for updated information These are difficult and uncertain times.

Upon notification of the positive case, and out of an abundance of caution, the building was cleaned and disinfected, including classrooms, office areas, conference rooms, and other common areas.

Note: The definition of “close contact” does not include all other individuals on the same floor or in the same building as a positive individual unless they also meet criteria (1) or (2). Fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine if they have a close contact exposure to someone with COVID-19, as long as they don’t have symptoms. Fully vaccinated people who experience any symptoms suggestive of COVID19 should isolate and contact their healthcare provider for testing. An individual can be considered fully vaccinated 14 days after completion of a COVID‐19 vaccination series (after the second dose of a 2‐dose series, or after one dose of a single‐dose vaccine).

Persons for whom we know were in close contact with the positive individual were immediately notified and provided guidance on next steps, including how any students impacted would receive instruction during quarantine. For your awareness, DC Health defines a close contact in a PK-12 setting as, “Someone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period, starting from two days before illness onset (or for asymptomatic infected people, two days prior to positive test collection) until the time the infected person is isolated.” Since DCPS has layered mitigation measures in place at our schools, students who were in a classroom and within 3 to 6 feet of another student who reported a positive test such that all were engaged in consistent and correct use of well-fitting face masks are not considered a close contact.

Upon notification of a positive case, and out of an abundance of caution, the building was cleaned and disinfected, including classrooms, office areas, conference rooms, and other common areas. Persons for whom we know were in close contact with the individual were immediately notified and provided guidance based on DC Health and CDC guidelines. Close contact is defined as: (1) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time (e.g., being in the same office or classroom as a positive and symptomatic individual), or (2) having direct contact with the infectious secretions from an individual with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on). Note: The definition of “close contact” does not include all other individuals on the same floor or in the same building as a positive individual, unless they also meet criteria (1) or (2). Per current DC Health guidance, you do not need to be tested or undergo voluntary quarantine based on this possible exposure. However, we strongly urge you to closely monitor yourself and your family for symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If you develop any of these symptoms at all, please stay home and contact your healthcare provider immediately for advice. You should also contact your school to let them know your student will be staying home. As a reminder, here are the steps that we can all take to keep ourselves, families, and others around us safe from COVID-19: • Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, after using the restroom, and upon returning home • Cover your cough and/or sneeze into a tissue then discard in the trash and immediately wash your hands for 20 secs or use hand sanitizer • Avoid touching your eyes, face, and mouth • Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces • Stay home if you are sick • Practice social distancing • Visit coronavirus.dc.gov for updated information These are difficult and uncertain times.

Visit vaccinate.dc.gov to get started and find a free school clinic near you. I know that this has been a trying time for our community. We will continue to keep you informed about our health and safety measures and work together to ensure we have a strong, robust, and safe school year.
